# Load and Solar Power Forecasting in a Residential Distributed Energy System
This repository contains the code for my CS 230: Deep Learning final project, and it has implementations of many deep learning and statistical models I experimented with. The final report for the project is also included.  

Unfortuantely, the data is not publicly available, but it is possible to download the code and experiment with it on your own. However, UCI provides some data (link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/individual+household+electric+power+consumption) that might need some preprocessing depending on your application.
